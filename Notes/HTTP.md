HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundational protocol of the World Wide Web. Think of it as the language that web browsers (clients) and web servers use to communicate with each other, allowing you to request and receive web pages, images, and other data. It operates on a request-response model.

## How HTTP Works: The Request-Response Cycle


The entire process works in a simple cycle:

1.  **The Client sends a Request**: Your web browser (the client) creates an HTTP request message and sends it to a server. This request asks for a specific resource, like an HTML page, an image, or data from an API.
2.  **The Server processes the Request**: The web server receives the request, understands what the client is asking for, and finds the resource or performs the requested action.
3.  **The Server sends a Response**: The server then crafts an HTTP response message and sends it back to the client. This response includes the requested data (like the web page) and a **status code** indicating whether the request was successful.

This process is **stateless**, meaning each request is treated as an independent transaction. The server doesn't remember anything about previous requests from the same client.

## HTTP Methods (Verbs)

HTTP methods, often called "verbs," define the **action** the client wants to perform on a specific resource. They are the most important part of the HTTP request.

Here are the most common methods explained in depth:

### GET
The **GET** method is used to **retrieve** or fetch data from a server. It's the most common method you use every day. When you type a URL into your browser's address bar and hit Enter, you're sending a GET request.

* **Purpose**: To read information.
* **Characteristics**:
    * **Safe**: It should not change the state of the server (read-only).
    * **Idempotent**: Making the same GET request multiple times will produce the same result.
    * **Cacheable**: Responses can be stored by the browser or intermediary caches to speed up future requests.
* **Example**: Fetching a user's profile from `https://api.example.com/users/123`.

### POST
The **POST** method is used to **submit** new data to the server to create a new resource.

* **Purpose**: To create a new entity.
* **Characteristics**:
    * **Not Safe**: It changes the state of the server by adding new data.
    * **Not Idempotent**: Sending the same POST request multiple times will likely create multiple new resources.
* **Example**: Submitting a sign-up form to create a new user account. The user's details (name, email) are sent in the body of the POST request.

### PUT
The **PUT** method is used to **update** an existing resource completely. If the resource doesn't exist, PUT can sometimes create it.

* **Purpose**: To replace an entire resource with new data.
* **Characteristics**:
    * **Not Safe**: It changes the state of the server.
    * **Idempotent**: Sending the same PUT request multiple times with the same data will have the same effect as sending it once—the resource will be in the same final state.
* **Example**: Updating a user's entire profile. You must send all the user's data (name, email, address), and it will completely overwrite the old profile.

### PATCH
The **PATCH** method is used to apply a **partial modification** to a resource. Unlike PUT, you only need to send the data you want to change.

* **Purpose**: To apply a partial update.
* **Characteristics**:
    * **Not Safe**: It changes the state of the server.
    * **Not Idempotent**: Making the same PATCH request multiple times could have unintended consequences (e.g., if the request is to "add 10 to a value").
* **Example**: Updating only a user's email address without affecting their name or other profile information.

### DELETE
The **DELETE** method is used to **remove** a specified resource.

* **Purpose**: To delete a resource.
* **Characteristics**:
    * **Not Safe**: It changes the state of the server.
    * **Idempotent**: Deleting the same resource multiple times results in the same outcome—the resource is gone. The server will likely return a `404 Not Found` on subsequent attempts.
* **Example**: Deleting a specific post from a blog via `https://api.example.com/posts/45`.

### Other Methods

* **HEAD**: Identical to a GET request, but the server returns only the headers and status code, **without the response body**. It's useful for checking if a resource exists or getting its metadata (like `Content-Length`) before downloading it.
* **OPTIONS**: Used to describe the communication options (i.e., which HTTP methods are allowed) for the target resource. Often used in CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

## HTTP Status Codes

When a server sends a response, it always includes a 3-digit status code that quickly tells the client the outcome of its request. They are grouped into five classes:

* **1xx (Informational)**: The request was received, and the process is continuing.
* **2xx (Success)**: The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
    * `200 OK`: The standard success response.
    * `201 Created`: The request was successful, and a new resource was created (e.g., after a POST request).
* **3xx (Redirection)**: Further action needs to be taken to complete the request.
    * `301 Moved Permanently`: The requested page has been moved to a new URL.
* **4xx (Client Error)**: The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
    * `400 Bad Request`: The server cannot understand the request.
    * `403 Forbidden`: The client does not have permission to access the content.
    * `404 Not Found`: The server could not find the requested resource.
* **5xx (Server Error)**: The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.
    * `500 Internal Server Error`: A generic error message for an unexpected condition on the server.
