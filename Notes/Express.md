# Input

```javascript
const express = require("express");
console.log(express);

const app = express();
console.log(app);
```

# Output

Of course. Let's break down the output of your code in detail, exploring the architecture of Express.js and the roles these two logged objects play.

The core concept to understand is the **"factory function"** pattern. In your code, `express` is a factory, and `app` is the product it creates.

### Output 1: `console.log(express)` ‚Äî The Factory üè≠

When you execute `const express = require("express");`, you are importing the entire Express.js module. The primary export of this module is a function, but it's a special kind of function that also has other useful properties attached to it.

`console.log(express)` will print this main function to the console. It will look something like this:

```
[Function: createApplication] {
  json: [Function: json],
  static: [Function: serveStatic],
  Router: [Function: Router],
  urlencoded: [Function: urlencoded],
  query: [Function: query],
  request: [IncomingMessage],
  response: [ServerResponse]
}
```

_(Note: The exact output can vary slightly between versions, but the structure is the same.)_

#### In-Depth Breakdown

- **`[Function: createApplication]`**: This is the core of the output. It tells you that the `express` variable itself is a function. This is the **factory function**. Its job is to create and return a new Express application object every time you call it, like you do in the next line: `const app = express();`. This ensures that each application you create is a separate, isolated instance.

- **Attached Properties (The "Toolbox")**: The factory function comes with a built-in "toolbox" of essential utilities that you might need while building an application. These are attached as properties directly onto the `express` function itself.

  - **`express.json()`**: This is one of the most commonly used pieces of **middleware**. Middleware functions are like plugins that process a request before it reaches your final route handler. `express.json()` specifically looks for incoming requests with a `Content-Type: application/json` header and automatically parses the JSON body into a JavaScript object, making it available as `req.body`.
  - **`express.static(root, [options])`**: This is middleware used to serve static files like images, CSS, and JavaScript files. For example, `app.use(express.static('public'))` tells your app to serve files directly from a folder named `public`.
  - **`express.urlencoded({ extended: false })`**: Similar to `express.json()`, this middleware parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads (often from HTML form submissions).
  - **`express.Router()`**: This is a mini-factory of its own. It creates a new `router` object. Routers are used to group related route handlers into modular, manageable files, which helps keep your main application file clean.

So, logging `express` shows you the **blueprint and the toolkit** for building an application.

### Output 2: `console.log(app)` ‚Äî The Product üöó

When you execute `const app = express();`, you are calling the factory function. It runs and produces a new, fully-formed Express application object. This `app` object is the central component of your web server.

`console.log(app)` will print this large, complex object. It contains all the methods and properties needed to define routes, apply middleware, and start the server. The output is extensive, but its most important parts are the methods you use to build your server.

#### In-Depth Breakdown

The `app` object is designed to manage the entire **request-response cycle**. Its methods allow you to define how the server should react to different requests from a client (like a web browser).

Key methods and properties you'd see on the `app` object include:

- **Routing Methods**: These methods correspond directly to HTTP request verbs. Their purpose is to match an incoming request's method and URL path to a specific handler function.

  - **`app.get(path, handler)`**: Handles HTTP GET requests (e.g., fetching a webpage).
  - **`app.post(path, handler)`**: Handles HTTP POST requests (e.g., submitting a form).
  - **`app.put(path, handler)`**: Handles HTTP PUT requests (e.g., updating a resource).
  - **`app.delete(path, handler)`**: Handles HTTP DELETE requests (e.g., deleting a record).
  - **`app.all(path, handler)`**: Matches any HTTP method for a given path.

- **Middleware Method**:

  - **`app.use([path], handler)`**: This is the primary way to apply middleware to your application. If a path is specified, the middleware runs only for that path. If no path is given, it runs for _every_ incoming request. This is how you "plug in" the tools from the `express` toolbox, like `app.use(express.json());`.

- **Server Control Method**:

  - **`app.listen(port, [callback])`**: This method starts the server. It tells your application to bind to a specific network port and "listen" for any incoming connections. The optional callback function is executed once the server has successfully started. This is typically the very last thing you do in your script.

- **Configuration Methods**:

  - **`app.set(name, value)`**: Used to set application-level variables. For example, `app.set('view engine', 'ejs')` tells Express to use the EJS templating engine.
  - **`app.get(name)`**: Used to retrieve a value set with `app.set()`.

So, logging `app` shows you the **actual, running machine** that you will configure and operate.
